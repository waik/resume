## 3. What else to do in Amsterdam

Amsterdam is a great city to enjoy the outdoors as a grown up but also as family with little ones.
- Do go and enjoy Oosterpark with bird watching, kids playgrounds, or just chilling and watching the Dutch being Dutch (Oosterpark, 1012 AA Amsterdam)
- Fancy a beer in the sun while facing the Amsterdam Zoo (Artis) http://www.cafegollem.nl/
- Wanna go swimming in front of a huge pirate ship? Explore the http://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl/ & https://www.marineterrein.nl/project/swimming-in-water/
- Soak in the sun & watch the boats at http://www.hannekesboom.nl/ just behind the Marineterrein <br>
